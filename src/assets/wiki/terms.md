# Intent

The BikeTag Project aims to be the register of BikeTag Games all over the world, providing BikeTag Images for players on various platforms to enjoy through those platforms, as well as through BikeTag Project websites and applications. BikeTag is a social game that is played in real life and shared with others with the intention to be social. To meet this goal of the players of the game of BikeTag, The BikeTag Project leverages content creation on various public platforms in order to share BikeTag Images publicly with users of those platforms and the Open Internet.

# Open-Source

BikeTag is a Free and Open-Source Project. To be able to provide Open-Source and free services to all BikeTag Players, the BikeTag Platform integrates with the following platforms: Imgur, Reddit, Sanity, Twitter. These platforms offer the ability to share images and text, which players create through the use of BikeTag Project websites and applications, freely and publicly with all users of the internet. Core to the BikeTag Project’s mission to provide the ability to play the game of BikeTag without needing to log into anything, we achieve this technological feat through the use of publicly available Application Programming Interfaces developed by these platforms using accounts created by the BikeTag Project. We have chosen these platforms for their stated protection of copyrighted material as well as their extension of rights to be able to share such material publicly.

# Use

After having submitted any text or images or other materials to any BikeTag Project website or application, Anonymous content will be assumed under the public domain per the discretion of the BikeTag Project. While it is a primary goal of the BikeTag Project’s mission to provide the ability to play BikeTag Games all over the world without needing to log into anything, this also means that What You Type Is What You Get — meaning that in order to accept submissions using an anonymized “name” text field, we must accept that a “name” is all we have to identify BikeTag Players with the content that is created for public use.

# Content

For any BikeTag Player who uses third-party accounts to “log in”, BikeTag Post submissions may contain identifiers that associate BikeTag Posts with that account. These features, enabled through third-party BikeTag Developers, allow BikeTag Players to create content that is under their explicit control and copyrighted ownership. Such features, existing both within the BikeTag Project’s websites and applications as well as outside of the BikeTag Project through use of the BikeTag Platform API, provide BikeTag Players the ability to have the content removed from the BikeTag Platform and associated services.

# Copyright and Ownership

BikeTag respects the intellectual property of others and requires that users of our Services do the same. If you believe that anything on BikeTag Project website or applications infringes a copyright or a trademark that you own or control, you may notify the BikeTag Project by sending an email to: support@biketag.org. Also, please note that if you knowingly misrepresent that any activity or material on our Service is infringing, you may be liable to the BikeTag Project for certain costs and damages incurred by the BikeTag Project as a result.
