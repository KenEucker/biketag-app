## TODO

[ ] Develop restful API and provide all data needed for existing BikeTag Vue App to function

[ ] Develop restful API endpoints for active gameplay features including; queueing a tag, approving a tag, editing a tag, deleting a tag.

[ ] Develop serverless functions to support the process by which BikeTag Ambassadors administer BikeTag Games. (no FE component required)

[ ] Develop a frontend web component for BikeTag Ambassadors to log in using GitHub and be provided with the ability to access the administrative API endpoints developed in #2 and #3. (provided the ability means being provided the correct BikeTag Credentials for using the restful API endpoints, not a fully functional application that uses those endpoints)

[ ] Develop the serverless functions to support the process by which BikeTag Administrators (godmode) can grant API access to third-party BikeTag developers. (as with previous endeavors, this does not require a fully functional FE component)

[ ] Develop the subscribe and notify serverless functions with complementing restful API endpoints in order for the BikeTag App (Vue) to register players (using Redis) for notifications and to send push notifications to those registered players of the BikeTag App (Vue).
